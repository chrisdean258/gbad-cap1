GBAD-GUI RELEASE NOTES
 
NOTE:  The GBAD GUI creates a file called ~.GBAD/GUI.properties, which is used
       to allow the user to specify what version of the GBAD executables and
       GraphViz executables they want to use.  The first time the GBAD GUI
       executes it creates this file, along with several java settings,
       including the java run-time environment. The GUI.properties file should
       NOT be copied between machines, as the java settings are specific to
       the machine.  If the O/S is upgraded/changed, java versions are
       changed, etc., the user should delete their GUI.properties file and let
       the GBAD GUI regenerate it for the current environment.

Version 3.1
 
- Allows -noOpt option to be configured from GUI.
 
Version 3.0
 
- Allowed both GBAD-MDL and GBAD-FSM to be run from the GUI.
- Changed input file format.

gbad-fsm
========

gbad-fsm was created from the gaston frequent subgraph mining tool 
(http://www.liacs.nl/~snijssen/gaston/).

gbad-fsm can be run in two separate phases, or all at once.


RUNNING PHASE I.
Phase I is for the discovery of the best substructure and all of its instances.  

For example, the following command:

        gbad-fsm [-mst <threshold>] [-graph <graph input file>] [-phase 1]
   
        with options:    -subInstOut <output>  (output the substructure instances (NOTE: This file can get
                          very large!))
                         -bestSubInstOut  (write the best substructure instances to the best_sub.inst file)
                         -phase <number>  (run phase 1 or 2 separately)

results in the following two files being created:

        best_sub.gbad, which consists of the best substructure
        best_sub.inst (if -bestSubInstOut option is specified), which consists of all instances of the best substructure

The value specified for -mst is the minimum support threshold.  Which 
means that the substructure shown in best_sub.g is a subgraph that is 
included in at least <threshold> transactions (or "t"s in the graph input file).


RUNNING PHASE II.
Phase II is for the discovery of the anomalies.

For example, once there are best_sub.g and best_sub.inst files, the following
command:

        gbad-fsm [<gbad algorithm> <gbad threshold>] [-mst <threshold>] [-graph <graph input file>] [-phase 2]

will run the specified <gbad algorithm> on the specified <graph input file>.

Currently, the options for <gbad algorithm> are:

        - mdl  , for the MDL algorithm
        - mps  , for the MPS algorithm
        - prob  , for the Prob algorithm

The <gbad threshold> specifies how much change one is willing to accept for
detection an anomaly.  This is a value between 0.01 and 0.99.

For the MPS algorithm, the -mst <threshold> should be the same as
what was specified in Phase I.  For the MDL algorithm, this value should be 1.
The Prob algorithm should not have a <gbad threshold> specified.


RUNNING BOTH PHASES.
The command:

        gbad-fsm [<gbad algorithm> <gbad threshold>] [-mst <minimum support threshold>] [-graph <graph input file>] 
        
        with options:    -subInstOut <output>  (output the substructure instances (NOTE: This file can get
                          very large!))
                         -bestSubInstOut  (write the best substructure instances to the best_sub.inst file)
                         -phase <number>  (run phase 1 or 2 separately)
                         - mdl  , for the MDL algorithm
                         - mps  , for the MPS algorithm
                         - prob  , for the Prob algorithm
        
will run both phases.
